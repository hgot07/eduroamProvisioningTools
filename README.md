# eduroamProvisioningTools
Tools and example codes for eduroam profile provisioning. (eduroam-OpenRoaming is not supported, but modification would be easy.)

## Features
- The tools and codes help institutions develop their own eduroam profile provisioning systems.
- The CGI scripts allow end users to download eduroam profile and configure the user device without typing in eduroam ID/password (or certificate). [geteduroam](https://www.geteduroam.app/) is a recommended app for device configuration.

## Directory layout
- user: Website with user's login, i.e., with access control.
- ext: Open website where Windows Wi-Fi Settings can download the profile from.
- etc: Storage for configuration and certificate files.
